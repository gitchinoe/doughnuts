# Doughnuts

I created this small concept with the sole purpose of gaining prior knowledge for my upcoming internship at Sogeti. I had no experience with `three.js` before so I wanted to come prepared. Fortunately, this graduation internship was a success.

Coded with `react` and `react-three-fiber`. Models were made in Spline.
